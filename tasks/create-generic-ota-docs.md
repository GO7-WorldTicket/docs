# Create generic OTA docs

## Goals
- We want to create generic OTA docs that can be used by other airlines.
- Read the previous OTA docs in PDF format, located at `/Users/sittiwetmahapratoom/Downloads/ota-quick-start-guide.pdf`.
- Create new OTA docs in Markdown format, located at `ota` folder.
- Document should be structured in a way that is easy to read and understand.
- The layout / Table of content you can follow the existing in this repository, "OTA_API_SAR.md" and all related md files like changelog.md and unders `ota/endpoints`
- We want to create a new generic version but keeping the existing one so create a new files and folder, make sure it won't interfere with the existing one.
- The new docs should be easy to convert to html like it was for SAR version, using the same tool and configuration.
